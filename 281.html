    <h1>Projects - EECS 281</h1>
  
    <h2 class = "projecttext"> Pathway Optimization</h2>
    <p>Implemented Prim’s algorithms to identify the shortest pathway between given coordinate points in a minimum-spanning tree. I also different algorithms to approach the Traveling Salesperson Problem, where one was a heuristic that gave a "quick" answer while the other, slower algorithm gave the optimal answer.</p>
    </br>
      <h2 class = "projecttext">Three-Dimensional Puzzle </h2>
    <p>
      Applied data structures like deques, stacks, and queues in order to implement a backtracing algorithm to find an endpoint given an arbitrary starting point in three-dimensional puzzles (sizes ranging from 4 tile spaces to 7 million). Created and modified custom data structures to allow for multiple modes of both input and output (coordinate list and map).
    </p>
  </br>
  <h2 class = "projecttext">Priority Queues & Pairing Heaps</h2>
<p>
  This project was meant to simulate a video game in which the player (the user) is supposed to choose the highest-priority enemy to defeat. This was done with the use of priority queues and custom comparators. Additionally, the player could specify output modes that would detail previous player actions and enemy statistics (median lifespan, longest-living enemies, etc.) by implementing the aforementioned data structures in other ways.
</p>

</br>
<h2 class = "projecttext">Logfile Management</h2>
<p>
  Utilized hash tables to create a tool for storing, sorting, and generating log file reports. This project emphasized algorithmic runtime efficiency as well as taking advantage of the C++ STL in order to create the simplest, quickest, and most elegant solution.
