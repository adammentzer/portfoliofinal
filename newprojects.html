      <p>One of my assignments for SI 110 was to do a design analysis of a website, mobile 	application, 
        or social media platform with respect to Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics for User Experience Design. 
        I chose to review the desktop version of Slack. 
        As the  pandemic necessitated heavy Slack use, I had curated a list of inadequacies (at least by my standards) in 
         its interface and was eager to showcase what I’d learned thus far in the class. 
         My main complaint was that it lacked a “landing page” for the user, as it instead constantly 
         forces the user to be in one of their workspaces. In other words, 
         there are no spaces for the user to have a high-level overview of their 
         groups or for them to “crash land” should they lose their place in the application’s interface.
          Among my other concerns were that some of the icons don’t represent what you would conventionally expect them to, 
          the tendency for the screen to get cluttered with information, and that Slack seemed to cater towards power 
          users rather than the average person.  </p>

      <p>One of my first classes at the University of Michigan was History 195, 
        a writing  class that examined global humanitarianism in
         the modern era. Among the required  
         readings was Anand Giridharadas’ <i>Winners Take All: 
         The Elite Charade of Changing the World</i>, about
        NGOs that would intentionally do ineffectual or self-serving
          work to perpetuate the plight of the needy so that they could continue to profit off of them.

        Discerning between organizations that follow through on their promises and 
        those that don’t is a difficult task, so when a couple of friends and 
        I were assigned a project where we were supposed to solve an issue, 
        this seemed like a natural fit. Our solution was to create an app (Chlarity) 
        that would allow organizations that DO honor their promises to more 
        intricately display where their funding goes. 
        That way, they could build consumer trust and promote their brand. 
        Organizations would sign on as partners, and then get direct access to 
        their target audience as well as other organizations for collaboration.

      <p>At my cousin’s wedding reception this past July, I was looking around at all of the 	tables trying to figure out if there was any rhyme or reason to the seating arrangements.  	
        Some tables were completely full (or even overfilled), 
        while others had plenty of vacant seats. 
        When she came around to my family’s table, I asked my cousin how she had arranged all of us. 
        She said that she and my new cousin-in-law had done the seating by hand, and that it was a 
        massive pain to take into account the different groups of people as well as the number of chairs/tables available to them. 
        Wanting to brush up on my Python skills, I decided that I’d make a tool for creating seating arrangements with 
        groups manually inputted by the user. The user could optimize for a given number of chairs at each table,
        finding how many people should be seated with a given number of tables, have the program determine how many chairs/tables are needed based on the average group size,
        letting each larger-than-average group get its own table, even though this increases the amount of empty seats. The program was designed so 
      that the number of open seats at each table was minimized and so that as few groups as 
      possible needed special accommodation (for each user preference).

      Having furthered my education since creating this project, I am currently working 
      on implementing disjoint sets to make sure that only people who know each other 
      (e.g. bride’s family/groom’s family) are seated together.</p>

      <p> Like a lot of people, I hate being bored and feeling stagnant. Even when I have free time, I often face a lapse in creativity or decision paralysis where I feel like I just can’t find something to do. After describing this problem to a friend, they referenced <a href = "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220736" style = "color: white;">this study about external reinforcement in decision making </a> 
        and how it helped them make their own decisions. 
        Knowing this, I resolved to create an app that would TELL me what to do when I was 
        bored rather than having to come up with something myself. 
        Because it wasn’t my own idea to shoot down, it was harder to refuse. 
      <br>
      <br>
        Aside from the reasons above, the purpose of this project was to introduce myself to Swift and 
        SwiftUI for iOS development. 
        The app itself works by taking user-defined parameters 
        such as number of people, budget, and the amount of time allotted for 
        the activity and randomly picks an activity that matches that criteria.</p>
